Vertical Map
-rotate perspective 180 degrees for each team?
--probably

Locked Camera
-Make it unlock when they focus?

Controls: Mouse or Keyboard?
-Leaning toward mouse to make game more interactive i.e. aimable skillshots
-Abilities: 2 or 3 + ulti. 2 might feel a little better control-wise, but 3 is probably better for the health of the game

Patterns
-Cone that spawns random small bullets within
--talked about how make the patterns semi-randomized may help emphasize and keep fresh the pattern dodging component
--Make it so that the really complex danmakus require team cooperation
---Implicit vs. Explicit danmaku synergies
----implicit ie two champions stacking their abilities to make an undogable
----explicit ie when these two spells are cast together, they get a bonus
-----Tet also poitned out that osme champions could have "support" abilities that empower other champs attacks
-Should ults be like bombs, including having a bullet clear effect?
--still undecided for now

Health vs. Instadeath
-Heath would make it more on-par with most MOBAs.  May be possible to make the game mechanics somehow empower Instadeath

To keep last hitting in the game, make it that when a minion is lasthit it should explode into bullets
